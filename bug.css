The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is overridden unexpectedly */
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: purple;
}

div .special-paragraph {
  color: orange; /* This rule is correctly applied */
}
```

In this example, the unexpected behavior arises from the interaction between inheritance and specificity. The `div p` selector has a higher specificity than the `p` selector, so the `color: green` rule should override `color: red`.  However, this is often misinterpreted, and developers may expect `color: red` to still apply to `<p>` elements within `<div>` containers. This is because inheritance would suggest it should cascade down.

The correct behavior is demonstrated by `div .special-paragraph`. The class selector adds to specificity, allowing the `color: orange` to override the `color: purple` rule. The difference in behaviour arises from how CSS specificity calculation handles element selectors vs class selectors in addition to inheritance.
