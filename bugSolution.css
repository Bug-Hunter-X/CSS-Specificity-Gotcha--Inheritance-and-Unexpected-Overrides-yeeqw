The solution involves understanding the correct way to apply styles to nested elements: 

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This is correct; it overrides the inherited red */
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: purple;
}

div .special-paragraph {
  color: orange; /* This is also correct */
}
```

Alternatively, to maintain the `color:red` for `<p>` elements within divs:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  /* color: green; */
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: purple;
}

div .special-paragraph {
  color: orange; 
}
```

This improved solution utilizes a clear separation of styles, so inheritance can be used. Using `!important` can work but isn't recommended for maintainability.
